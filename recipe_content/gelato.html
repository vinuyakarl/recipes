    <p>Gelato is a delightful frozen dessert that originates from Italy. 
        It is often referred to as Italian ice cream, but it has a distinct texture and flavor that sets it apart. 
        Gelato is known for its creamy, velvety consistency, achieved by using a higher proportion of milk to cream compared to traditional ice cream recipes. 
        This results in a denser and smoother texture. 
        Gelato comes in a wide array of flavors, ranging from classic favorites like chocolate and vanilla to unique and indulgent combinations like pistachio, hazelnut, and fruity sorbets. 
        With its rich flavors and luxurious mouthfeel, gelato is a beloved treat enjoyed by people around the world, transporting them to the streets of Italy with every delicious scoop.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (500ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 cup (250ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>Optional: Flavorings such as chocolate chips, fruite puree, or nuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it reaches a gentle
            simmer. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar and egg yolks until well
            combined.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking continuously to prevent
            the eggs from curdling.</li>
        <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly,
            until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon. This forms the custard base.</li>
        <li>Remove the custard from heat and stir in the heavy cream and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture cool to room temperature, then cover and refrigerate for at least
            4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>Once chilled, transfer the mixture to an ice cream maker and churn according to the
            manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        <li>If desired, add any flavorings such as chocolate chips, fruit puree, or nuts during the
            last few minutes of churning.</li>
        <li>Once the gelato reaches a soft, creamy consistency, transfer it to a lidded container
            and freeze for at least 2 hours or until firm.</li>
        <li>Serve the gelato in bowls or cones, and enjoy the delicious homemade treat!</li>
