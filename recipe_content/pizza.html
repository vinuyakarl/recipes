    <p>Pizza is a popular and beloved dish that originated in Italy but has gained worldwide recognition. 
        It consists of a round, flat dough base topped with various ingredients and baked in an oven. 
        The dough is typically made from flour, water, yeast, and salt, and it undergoes a process of fermentation to develop flavor and achieve a light and crispy texture. 
        The toppings can vary widely, ranging from classic options like tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil, to a wide array of meats, vegetables, and other flavorful additions. 
        Once assembled, the pizza is baked until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbling. 
        Pizza is enjoyed for its delicious combination of flavors, textures, and versatility, making it a favorite choice for casual meals, gatherings, and even special occasions.

            the cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little extra-virgin olive oil over the pizza. Season with Salt
            and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Carefully transfer the pizza (on the baking sheet or pizza peel) to the
            preheated oven or onto the hot pizza stone, if using.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for about 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden brown
            and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
